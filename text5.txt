The kitchen feels unnaturally cold, the air thick with a sense of neglect. The dim light flickers above, casting shadows that seem to shift and crawl along the walls. The countertops are covered in grime, the sink stained with old, dried stains. A faint smell of rot hangs in the air, seeping from the corners where the mold has taken root. The cupboards creak with age, their contents hidden from sight, as if they’re guarding secrets long forgotten. The floor is cold, slick with dampness, and every step echoes in the silence, a reminder that you’re completely alone in this forsaken place. You don’t know where you are, but you sense that the kitchen itself holds the answer—if only you could decipher it.
