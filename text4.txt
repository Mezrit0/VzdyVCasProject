The air is cold, and the darkness wraps around you like a heavy cloak. Every step feels uncertain,
 as if the very ground beneath you is unfamiliar, shifting. A faint musty smell fills the space, and you can feel the presence of mold clinging to the walls,
 slowly growing in the damp corners. The place feels abandoned, like no one has been here for ages. There are shelves, but they seem empty,
  filled with nothing but dust and decay. You can’t tell where you are—whether it's a forgotten store, a place lost in time, or something worse. Everything feels wrong.
 It's as if the world outside has been left behind, and you're trapped in this eerie, frozen moment, unsure how to escape.
