The garage is a place of darkness and dampness, its air heavy with the scent of oil, rust, and something faintly metallic. The only light comes from a flickering bulb above, casting long, trembling shadows that seem to move of their own accord. The floor is cold, littered with forgotten tools and pieces of broken machinery, all covered in a thin layer of dust and mold. The walls are cracked, the paint peeling away in large patches, revealing the decay beneath. There’s an unsettling silence, broken only by the creaks and groans of the building settling, as if it’s alive. You can’t tell how long you’ve been here or how you even got inside, but amidst the chaos and the ruin, there’s something else: a key, half-hidden beneath a rusted metal crate, glinting faintly in the dim light. It feels almost like a lifeline, the one thing that could lead you out of this forsaken place. But you know, reaching for it might come with its own cost.
