The engine sputters, then dies. Snow blankets the road, swallowing the last sign of civilization behind you. The only sound is the wind howling through the trees, a deep, hollow wail that makes your skin crawl.

It’s pitch black. No streetlights, no houses—just the endless forest pressing in from all sides. Then, in the distance, you see something. A figure. Standing perfectly still. Watching.

Your breath turns to fog as you take a step back. The air feels heavier, the silence more suffocating. You reach for your phone—no signal. Your stomach knots as the figure moves. Slowly. Deliberately.

You were never supposed to be here. But now, there’s no way out.
