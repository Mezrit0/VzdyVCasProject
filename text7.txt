The main entrance stands before you, bathed in the dim light of the fading day. It’s the kind of
 door that feels like a threshold between two worlds—one you’ve just escaped from and one that feels just as uncertain.
  The heavy wooden door creaks as it swings open, revealing an empty, desolate street outside. The air is thick, carrying a chill that cuts through you,
   but it’s different from the damp, suffocating cold of the garage. There’s a strange stillness here, as if the world beyond has been frozen in time,
    waiting for something to happen. You step forward, the key still clutched tightly in your hand, but even now, you can’t shake the feeling that something isn’t right. The place you’ve escaped from might be behind you, but its grip on you isn’t so easily broken.
The key in your hand feels heavier,
 as though it’s tied to something more than just the door you’ve passed through.
