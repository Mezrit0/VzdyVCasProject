You’re a minimum-wage delivery driver at Sempre puntuale Pizza,
a rundown excuse for a restaurant that barely meets health standards. The grease-stained walls reek of old cheese
, and the oven is probably a decade overdue for a cleaning. Your boss, Tony, is a walking cliché—constantly yelling, cutting your hours,
 and paying just enough to keep you from quitting.
The customers? They either don’t tip, complain about everything, or make you wait at the door for five minutes before realizing they even ordered a pizza. The best part? If you're even a minute late, you’re the one who gets yelled at, not the idiot who gave you the wrong address.
Your paycheck barely covers rent, your bike is falling apart, and the only thing keeping you going is the thought that one day, somehow, you’ll get out of here. But for now, you’re stuck.
Welcome to the grind. Hope you like cold pizza and existential dread.
